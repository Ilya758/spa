# Welcome to SPA!

### Feel free to observe custom Storybook-components (i.e. stories) we're using across this project.

- hierarchical tree divided by groups

- groups divided by folders

- every folder contains one or more **stories**.

### Story - graphical and modular representation of an abstraction layer (component), the smallest part.

To deal with custom stories observe the **navbar** near in the left panel.

- **CHOOSE** the component you want
- **CLICK** to it's description
- **INTERACT** by changing appearance/behaviour etc

### A single story contains:

- description + UI-representation

- interface declaration (in integration with `autodocs`)

- nested stories (unnecessary)

### Thahks for your patience and let's dive into project.
