Rex decided to spare this ugly white blanket that my  grandmother gave me from her war days. We never threw it away because we felt bad.  Seeing Rex sleep on this blanket made us  happy. At least someone was using this  blanket, even if we had to rebuy brand new sheets because we have such an amazing dog. We love you Rex."
